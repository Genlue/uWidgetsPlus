/// native side (Skia surfaces, shell icon handles, DWM composition buffers) is only released by
/// the finalizers that a mostly-idle GC may not run for a long while. The result is the classic
/// "it creeps up to several hundred megabytes" report.
///
/// So: a low-frequency, self-limiting sweep. It only does anything when the process is actually
/// holding more than <see cref="ThresholdBytes"/>, and the collection runs off the UI thread, so a
