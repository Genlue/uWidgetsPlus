/// <summary>
/// Verifies the fullscreen / maximized detection rule that suspends the widgets.
///
/// The decision function (<see cref="FullscreenWatcherService.AllScreensCovered"/>) is pure,
/// so every case is checked deterministically — including the coordinate pathology observed
/// on the development machine, where a DPI-unaware caller saw a normal window as
/// (480,142)-(2538,1306) on a 2048×1152 screen (DWM physical pixels next to virtualized
/// GetWindowRect values). That must NOT be mistaken for a covered desktop.
///
/// Multi-screen is part of the contract: the widgets are only suspended when <b>every</b>
/// attached screen is covered, so a maximized game on the primary monitor keeps the widgets
/// on the secondary one alive.
///
/// The live foreground-window signals are printed as well, so the Win32 layer is exercised.
